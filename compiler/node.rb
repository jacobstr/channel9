class Compiler

  ##
  # Node is the representation of a node in the Abstract Syntax Tree
  # (AST) of the Ruby code. It is typically fairly close in structure
  # to the sexp produced by the parser but there are some transforms
  # that are done at this stage:
  #
  # 1. Compiler special forms, such as Rubinius.asm which allows
  #    inline Rubinius "assembly" code. See plugins.rb for more of
  #    these.
  # 2. Combining redundant and removing obsolete nodes from the tree.
  #    The current parser is still mostly MatzRuby's and therefore
  #    contains some artifacts that we have no need for.
  # 3. Optimizations. At this time, there are not that many nor will
  #    there ever be huge amounts.
  # 4. Sexp transformations, somewhat akin to Lisp macros. These
  #    allow modifying the sexp, and therefore the code produced,
  #    as it is being compiled. The mechanism is currently very raw
  #    and the only transform supported is conditional compilation
  #    (e.g. not including debug statements in the bytecode at all.)
  #    Look for Rubinius.compile_if.
  #
  # The compiler is based on the Visitor pattern, and this stage is no
  # different. First, for every type of sexp node possible in Ruby code,
  # one of these Node subclasses will provide a handler (even if to just
  # skip over the node.) The   #kind method provides this mapping; for
  # example, the Iter node is kind :iter. The nodes register the kinds
  # they provide for lookups.
  #
  # The general model is simple. Each node has a   #consume method, it
  # may either be the default one defined in Node or a custom one if one
  # is needed. When the sexp is fed here, the kind mapping is used to
  # determine the kind of Node to construct, and the rest of the sexp is
  # fed to it. Typically the Node then goes through what is next in the
  # sexp, asking each layer to construct itself and   #consume anything
  # even further down the chain all the way until nothing of the sexp
  # remains. At this point those recursive calls start rolling back up
  # higher and higher, and the Nodes at each layer compose themselves of
  # the constituent parts they get back from in exchange for the sexp
  # they provided. Verification happens here, to ensure the AST is sane.
  # Most optimization occurs at the point before the sub-sexp would be
  # processed; for example a normal Call node (:call is the normal
  # method call representation) would have its arguments and body sent
  # for processing, but if the Call detects a special form starting with
  # +Rubinius+, it produces the special code for that instead and may
  # even completely omit processing parts of the sexp that a normal
  # Call node would.
  #
  # Some Node classes are a bit fancier in their   #consume: ClosedScope
  # Node subclasses manage a scope for local variables and so on, for
  # example. The basic idea of having its children produce the subtree
  # underneath it and then organising those bits to send back to its
  # parent in turn is still the same, they just have additional things
  # they are responsible for.
  #
  # In the end, the caller will be left with a single top-level Node
  # object (usually a Script) which then hierarchically contains the
  # rest of the AST. This object graph can then be passed on to the
  # bytecode producer. See bytecode.rb for that.
